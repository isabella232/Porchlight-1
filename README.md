# Porchlight
Porchlight is an Android app created by [Location Labs][1] for the [AT&T Mobile App Hackathon - New York City][2] that occured on November 6, 2015. It won the prizes of the "Best Overall App" and "Crush on Apps - Location Services". 

## Is it the project that was created during the hackathon?
Yes it is. But I've cleaned the code a little bit and added a mock mode so the app can work without backend. We were using a flask app with redis running on a laptop as backend. Now that the hackathon is over, there is no plan to keep a backend running. However, I included the non-mocked code too, so you can see what was done at that time. It won't work though, unless you implement a backend yourself.

## Who was on the team for the hackathon?
We were four people: a project manager, a designer, a backend engineer and a frontend engineer.
